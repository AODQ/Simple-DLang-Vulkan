# Simple DLang-Vulkan wavefront obj implementation

Following the Vulkan tutorial under https://vulkan-tutorial.com

I used my own wavefront obj loader from my DTR project and I haven't tested it
with any textured models. I put this up here as a reference to other people
going through the tutorial in D, as there doesn't exist any open-source project
that I have seen that uses Vulkan and D beyond a simple triangle rasterizer.
